              The css has the body tag as a grid with its items at the center.
              We have an uppercase styling and a maroon color for h1. The
              paragraphs tag has font-bold, span with red color and span within

              the Critical Rendering Path - anyone heard about this? Yes, no?

            <p>
              Critical Rendering Path is just the steps the browser goes through
              to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the
              screen. Optimizing these steps improves render performance. Sounds
              interesting?

            <p>
              Jokes aside, the truth is, before we can really optimize the

              fundamental. Lets go back to our HTML:

              In Chrome DevTools, you can see the actual time taken to perform
              this step, usually shown as Parse HTML - in the example above, it
              took us ~1ms to convert a chunk of HTML into a DOM tree.
            </p>
            <p>Modern browsers are pretty fast at this now.</p>
            <p>
              For a larger page however, this parsing alone could take
              significantly longer especially on mobile devices. Wanna see what
              that looks like?

              This is what it looks like on a large HTML page with around
              ~3,00,000 elements. I did simulate the mobile experience with some
              throttling but it's not far off from the actual website experience
              on my phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see even on a modern browser it takes a full 2.3
              seconds just to Parse HTML. That's just one step. The browser has
              to do a lot more before it can show anything on screen.

              Now... how many is too many DOM elements? According to lighthouse,
              it's around 1500 nodes. But don't take this number as a goal... if
              it's 1501 elements your HTML won't magically be slower. It's just
              a rough guideline number.

              For example the average wikipedia is ~5000 elements. But you don't

            <p>
              CSS bytes are converted into characters, then tokens, then nodes,

            </p>
            <p>
              Note that most of these are just the styles that we defined. Every
              browser provides a default set of styles also known as "user agent
              styles"‚Äî that's what is applied when we don't provide our own -
              our styles simply override these defaults.

              If you want to find out how much time CSS processing takes you can
              record a timeline in DevTools and look for "Recalculate Style''
              event. However, unlike DOM parsing, the timeline doesn't show a
              separate "Parse CSS" entry, and instead captures parsing and CSSOM
              tree construction, plus the calculation of computed styles under
              this one event.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the HTML spec page the Recalculate-style step takes around 0.8
              second to process on my desktop machine - which as you can imagine
              is substantial.

              So, now we have the DOM and CSSOM. The browser has everything to
              render the page. Right?
            </p>
            <p>
              Well not exactly. The CSSOM and DOM are two different data
              structures. One represents the structure of the document and the
              other represents the styles to be applied to the elements of the
              document. Before the browser can turn our data to pixels it needs
              to first combine information from both the DOM and CSSOM. This
              combined structure is known as...

            <p>This is what that looks like...</p>
            <p>The render tree will also contain each node's computed styles</p>
            <p>
              A computed style is all the styles that applies to the element,
              even if there is no CSS specified for that element. For example,
              consider the font size of our paragraph element. Even though the
              element itself doesn't have a font size value, it inherits styles
              from parent element, or in this case from browser's initial value
              for that property.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, this is a simplified explanation... in reality there's a lot

            <p>Anyway... that how we have our Render tree.</p>
            <p>
              And now the browser has all the information it needs to start
              rendering pixels on screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, how does it do that? Well, until now the browser has
              calculated which nodes should be visible and their computed
              styles. It still doesn't know the exact size and position of each
              node in the current page.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example... consider our paragraph element again. The browser
              knows from computing the styles applied to the element that the
              font-size is 16px and that it should be bold. But without further
              calculations, it cannot determine where in the page it should be,
              who wide would it be (which will depend on the text inside) etc.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              This ‚ÄúPaint‚Äù step is also visible in the devtools and the time
              taken for this step also varies. Just like the previous layout
              step painting performance also depends on the size of the DOM and
              even the type of styles too -> the more complicated the styles,
              the more time taken for painting. For example, a solid background
              colour is "cheap" to paint, while a drop shadow is "expensive" to

              That's it... that's how browsers convert random byte from the
              network and convert them to pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even for our simple demo page, the browser requires quite a bit of
              work to render to the screen. And if either the DOM or CSSOM were
              modified, the browser would have to repeat the entire process in
              order to figure out which pixels would need to be re-rendered on
              the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can imagine, the speed with which we can see our page on
              the screen is determined by how fast the browser can execute the
              above steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Optimizing these steps helps with initial render speed and this
              path is called the critical rendering path.
            </p>
            <p>
              We did talk about a few things regarding optimization of the above
              steps. Keep the CSS simple, fewer HTML elements etc. But there is
              a lot more to critical rendering path optimizations that we just
              cannot cover in this session. If anyone is interested in a session
              on this, let me know. üôÇ
